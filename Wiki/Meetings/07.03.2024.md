Meeting Notes:

Progress of review:

- APRS Gateway: Started working on the architecture part.
  Validation is working.
  Problem before was that there were too many callbacks which led to issue where everything was being forced to be in the same threat.
  Python threading issue.
  We managed to fix it by splitting it into distinct threads.
  Custom handlers and receivers so it is more modular.
  Running integration tests on the virtual network. Further issues, have to use static classes as cant pass self into the callback.
  Changing the architecture allows us to not have to wait for days to receive more packets. So we can speed up testing.
  We want to do calibration. (maximum retransmissions)
  But none of this will appear in the final report.

  - Routing:
    Epidemic routing is being worked on. Explanation of what that is...
    Need speed in routing.
  - Simulator:
    Hypothesis testing for x networks.
    We figure which experiment we need to do to prove/disprove the hypothesis.
    Which scenarios are more likely to happen. Which scenario should have higher rating.
    What real work scenarios would be like.

  - Telemetry:
    Next telemetry experiments.

Fidn the number of visitors, how many would be there max number of nodes.
Real data in the peak district.
Most people stick to paths so better connectivity.
A database for number of nodes, how wide the paths/area is.

Critical analysis of meshtastic into the report for it being bad.
