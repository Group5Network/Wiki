Meeting Notes:

In the experiments sections, we can say they were done using a x under the licence of M7xxx. 

There will be two drafts checks, one for intro and background now and the other when we send Leandro to leandro (results, methodology and conclusion).

What work we worked on since last time...


Different injects rates / packet rates etc.

Need various scenarios for each routing so we can compare and contrast. 

Add a reference to a paper, so we can reference packet sending generation, what is it based on. whats the model for packet generation. What is it inspired by. What you have seen before.
If you think you done something origianl, say we came up with it. comapre it with what others did and say why its better if thats the case. 

Guideline -> how hard is it to bring a routing from simulator to real meshtastic nodes. 1-2 paragraphs in the final report, what did we have to do. A lot of embedded systems need to write code twice. 

Meshtastic node should not deal with 2 same packets from 2 different nodes but it sometimes does.
