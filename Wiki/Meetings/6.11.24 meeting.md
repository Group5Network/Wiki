## Discussion

- Good to agree on direction before Friday (woe)
- Alex: we want a project that’s cohesive
- Thomas: bing bong, a cohesive use-case gives us a solid direction, and makes things easier to test against
- Thomas: routing can easily be split into teams, instead of all 7 doing one thing
- Alex: probably split into 2 2s and a 3
- Charlie: “Me, Alice, and Ben being a 3 is easy as we live together”
- Thomas: be AGILEE, but Ben says the resources haven’t been an issue so far
- Michael: avoid islands of knowledge, general integration may require working as a 7
- Jacob: we don’t have to feel constrained to 2 or 3 subgoals
- Thomas: visualising the ideas is better
- Jacob: we need a use case

## Ideas:

- Routing
    - Comparison of routing algorithms
    - Hybrid routing with power efficiency — there’s a spectrum from different areas
- Improving the simulation (may be required)
    - The simulator as is is kinda bad, lots of room for improvement
    - Hard to test and evaluate routing without the simulator
    - Could be a whole project in itself — with comparison to real networks (sentiment against this as the project itself)
- Registering meshtastic nodes over APRS for racing in remote locations
    - People have been lost in marathons
    - Interactive APRS map where we can see people
    - Why is it better than the current solution
    - Needs more reliability of routing
    - generalising to cross protocol communication could be interesting
- Use-cases:
    - Could optimise for certain locations
    - Most nodes don’t move, mobile nodes are “interacting” with the static network
    - Routing with power guaranteed nodes
    - Search and rescue teams — having issues with no announcement-only channels
    - SOS situation
        - We need to make meshtastic more reliable

## Rabbit holes (what to do from now)

- Routing rabbit hole
- APRS rabbit hole

# Work

- Jacob & Thomas look at APRS gateways
- Michael & Alex & Alice try to flesh out routing algorithm ideas and which scenarios it will work in — can we achieve guaranteed delivery
- Charlie & Ben look at the simulator generally, also with adding alternate protocols, write down issues and potential fixes
