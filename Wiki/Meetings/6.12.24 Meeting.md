Discussion:

Those who want textbooks for foundation radio license: Leandro will order. (Potentially to Alice) There is also an online PDF for those who want less commitment.

Need to decide which of RSGB/Essex book

APRS can work well with other physical layers - can use APRS over LoRa physical layer

Channel Bridge rather than “frequency conversion” for gateway

Might need to alter allocation of tasks at some point down the line

Can only make concrete claims with real world tests → simulator provides unlimited observability in a controlled environment which may not be possible in real world (could be using data that in reality would have to be communicated within packets)

Testing - Can reduce power and add extra noise → assign a node to generate disruption, producing collisions

Low power radios could introduce non-determinism which would be present in a real life scenario

Reducing power increases SNR

Leandro’s ideas:

Observability - Adding future features to the new routing algorithm to get more information about network topology

Byzantine behaviour: nodes that are not cooperative, figure out this and “shun” them - communicate to other nodes that these should be ignored. Currently all nodes messages have the same importance - may need to deal with a “selfish” node.
