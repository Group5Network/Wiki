There might be more complex algorithms out there that could do the work better, commonly used for WANs. However, after testing, they are too computationally expensive for mesh networks like Meshtastic. These algorithms often require maintaining large routing tables, frequent updates, or heavy computation for path discovery, which can overwhelm the limited resources (CPU, memory, and bandwidth) available on low-power devices like those used in Meshtastic.

 **General Comparison**:

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: All three devices use the ESP32 chipset, meaning they share similar processing power, RAM, and storage capabilities.
- **Power**: All three are designed for low-power applications, with Li-Po batteries and power-saving features to extend runtime, especially in mesh networks where frequent transmissions might otherwise drain power.

**Limitations and Considerations**:

- **Memory and Processing Power**: While the ESP32 is a relatively powerful microcontroller for IoT applications, its RAM and flash memory may limit the execution of complex algorithms (e.g., large-scale routing tables, pathfinding algorithms).
- **Battery Life**: Heavy routing algorithms or frequent retransmissions could impact battery life, so careful power management is necessary.
