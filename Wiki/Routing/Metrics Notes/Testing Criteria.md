General criteria for what we should look for when testing. Here for reference. 

**Testing criteria:**
Robustness to Node Failures: Nodes may fail or go offline, requiring dynamic adjustments to the routing table.

Scalability: As the network grows, routing algorithms might struggle with increased complexity and traffic.

Energy Efficiency: Routing algorithms must balance path optimisation with energy consumption, especially for battery-operated nodes.

Load Balancing: Avoiding over-reliance on a few central nodes to prevent premature failure and maintain network performance.

Latency Sensitivity: In time-sensitive applications, routing algorithms need to minimise latency without sacrificing reliability.

Environmental Factors: Weather, terrain, and physical obstacles can significantly affect LoRaâ€™s performance, requiring adaptive algorithms.
