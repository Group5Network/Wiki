**How we define reliability:**
Increased likelihood that a packet reaches the destination. We can't guarantee since we are broadcasting (why cant we guarantee)

Packet delivery.

If a node joins randomly / disconnects, how much we should include this ebcause this depends on people. But it is different from robustness.

Reliabiity→ performance under normal circumstances. More robustness → how crazy does this go. Whats normal meshtastic rate, what rate to decide or try every? Thats a lot of data so its a stretch. Plot it over availability, with simulation (three dimensional rate) how metrics change depending availability for each algorithm. Might have a paper for it. How to do that for real nodes. RSGB discounts if we were to increase licencing further, organisation ourselves.
