A reasonable way to define success in routing improvements is by measuring a statistically significant increase in message delivery likelihood without introducing excessive overhead. Other research papers typically evaluate success using:

1. Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) – The percentage of messages successfully delivered compared to those sent.
2. Latency – The time taken for a message to reach its destination.
4. Scalability – Whether improvements hold across different node densities and network topologies.

For statistical significance, many studies use confidence intervals (95% CI) and hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to ensure improvements aren’t due to random chance. A common benchmark is an increase in delivery probability by 5-10% while maintaining low overhead.

We have large samples so probably not needed to do the above, just using the metrics.
