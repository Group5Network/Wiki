Can we consider 3 kinds of environments, dense, sparse and normal? Depends if we can input objects.

Can do at the end a comparison between default mesthatic, APRS, and improved mesthatic (plus different variations of integration of these algorithms to decide which combination is the best, maybe we decide that in the paper which if any of these additionals add benefit in isolation but maybe when we intergrate all of these, it will really slow down the network so might be important to only select a few).

And for the video, can do the same experiment but in the peak district :) on a hypothetical network. Find the limitations of these improvements.
